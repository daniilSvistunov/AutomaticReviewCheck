# Introduction

OKTemplate-Mono is a template for a SPA (single page application). It can be used to create new applications. The template uses vite v5.

# Getting Started

1. The usual, first run `npm install` or `npm i` to fetch dependencies.

2. Then you can do `npm run dev` to start the application.

If you get an authentification error that you couldn't be redirected, this may be because `npm run dev` opens `https://127.0.0.1:3000/`.
Open `https://localhost:3000` instead, and it should work.

You may need to be given some access in AzureAd goups to actually show up some data. 
If thats the case go to your local Projectleader.

# Azure Resources

- The Azure resource group needs to be configured.
- A storage account for the development build and deployment needs to be configured
